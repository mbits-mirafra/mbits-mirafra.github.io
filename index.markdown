mBits is an initiative by the engineers at [Mirafra Technologies](https://www.mirafra.com). 
Our goal is to create a repository of high quality Verification IPs which 
are open-source and free to use.

The VIPs will be developed with UVM following the best industry practices. 
They will come with comprehensive documentation and user guides. You can 
check the available VIPs on the [Projects](/projects) page.

The code in this repository is released under the permissive [MIT License](/license). 
Feel free to use it in your projects. 
You can write to [mbits@mirafra.com](mailto:mbits@mirafra.com) if you 
need help in using the VIPs in your verification environments.

We welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute, 
check out the [Guidelines](/contribute) page.
